# gpp-compiler package

This package allows you to press f5 to compile and run the selected .cpp file with g++.

You could probably configure this package to work with linux/mac, but currently there is no support for linux/mac.

## What you need
- g++ (you can install g++ by installing MinGW from [mingw.org](http://www.mingw.org/))
- "C:\MinGW\bin\" added to path.
